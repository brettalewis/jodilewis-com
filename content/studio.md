<p>Jodi has taught all of the following and more:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High school students preparing audition repertoire for college</li>
  <li>Adults participating in community theaters or community choirs</li>
  <li>Adults who have been labeled as "tone deaf" and who would like to move beyond this</li>
  <li>Adults and children who actively sing in church</li>
  <li>Singer/songwriters</li>
  <li>Band members of all musical genres</li>
</ul>
<p>Jodi works with each student to uncover and develop his or her unique voice. She also helps develop a person's musicianship and general musical skills such as note identification, rhythm and sight reading. Every student's lesson is different and geared towards his or her individual needs and desires.</p>
<p>Jodi has a flexible schedule which includes afternoon, evening and weekend hours. Please email her at <a href="mailto:studio@jodi-lewis.com">studio@jodi-lewis.com</a> for more information or if you would like to set up an initial lesson.</p>
