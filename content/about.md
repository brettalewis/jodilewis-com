<p>Jodi Lewis's love for Opera began when she sang in her first opera scene at the age of 14. She knew then that singing was what she wanted to do for the rest of her life. Her passion drove her to the University of Illinois where she received a Bachelors of Music in Vocal Performance. While at Illinois, Jodi had the opportunity to perform small roles in operas, such as <em>Dialogues of the Carmelites</em>, <em>La Périchole</em>, and <em>Suor Angelica</em>. She also was invited to Theaterhof in Humbach, Germany to sing in productions for their summer season.</p>
<p>In 2000, Jodi received a teaching assistantship at the Pennsylvania State University towards a Masters degree in Vocal Performance and Pedagogy. While completing her degree at Penn State, Jodi performed many opera roles, including Dido in <em>Dido and Æneas</em> and Isabella in the premiere opera, <em>Mrs. Satan</em>. Jodi moved to Raleigh in 2006 and opened a private voice studio, devoting the next few years to teaching. In September, 2009, she resumed performance activities by performing the role of Donna Anna in Triangle Opera Studios' production of <em>Don Giovanni</em>.</p>
<p>In 2012, she had the honor of singing with the North Carolina Symphony in their production of <em>The Music Man</em>.  She was also a featured soloist with Fayetteville Symphony's <em>Opera in Narration</em> concert, which was a collaboration between the symphony and Triangle Opera Studios.  Jodi regularly sings with the North Carolina Opera Chorus. She teaches voice lessons at multiple locations throughout the Triangle. She is a devoted wife and mother to her two children, Audrey and Connor and her husband, Brett.</p>
