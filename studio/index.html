  <h1>Studio</h1>
  <p>Jodi Lewis has a Masters degree in Vocal Performance/Pedagogy from the Pennsylvania State University and a Bachelors in Vocal Performance from the University of Illinois. Jodi has been teaching voice and performing for over fifteen years. She is passionate about sharing her knowledge with others to enhance their sense of security and pride in their voices. She is currently accepting voice students of all levels, ages and abilities.</p>
<p>Jodi does not teach one particular style of music, but rather helps the students develop the foundation and technique that will enable them to sing any style they choose.</p>
<p>Jodi has taught all of the following and more:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High school students preparing audition repertoire for college</li>
  <li>Adults participating in community theaters or community choirs</li>
  <li>Adults who have been labeled as "tone deaf" and who would like to move beyond this</li>
  <li>Adults and children who actively sing in church</li>
  <li>Singer/songwriters</li>
  <li>Band members of all musical genres</li>
</ul>
<p>Jodi works with each student to uncover and develop his or her unique voice. She also helps develop a person's musicianship and general musical skills such as note identification, rhythm and sight reading. Every student's lesson is different and geared towards his or her individual needs and desires.</p>
<p>Jodi has a flexible schedule which includes afternoon, evening and weekend hours. Please email her at <a href="mailto:studio@jodi-lewis.com">studio@jodi-lewis.com</a> for more information or if you would like to set up an initial lesson.</p>
